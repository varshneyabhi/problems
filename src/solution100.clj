;;;; Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1,2,â€¦,9 (in this order) 
;;;; such that the result is 100. For example 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.
;;;; This may not be best or optimized way, but it works. :)
;;;; Next step, process each set of recursion parallelly to speed up.
